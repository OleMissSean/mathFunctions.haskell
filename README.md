Assignment #1: Getting started with functional programming
Extended Deadline: Monday, 15 September 2014, 11:59 p.m.

    All students: Implement Exercises 1-5 and 7(a) in section 5.7 (on pages 46-7) of the instructor's Notes on Functional Programming using Haskell. In these exercises, try to find solutions using only the library functions we have talked about so far in these Notes.

    CSci 503 students: Also implements the other parts of exercise 7 on page 47 of the Notes. This is optional for CSci 450 students.

    Please format and document your program source code appropriately.

    Test your programs appropriately and thoroughly.

    When this assignment is complete, submit your program source code file and a file containing screen shots (or the text collected by something like the Unix script program.) Be sure that you identify yourself and the assignments in comments in the source file.

    Also submit a paper copy of the above files at the following class meeting.
